    /// points then only one of the argument values will be kept and passed to
    /// the generator. The specific argument value that is passed may be any of
    /// the argument values passed since the last yield point.
    ///
    /// # Return value
    /// The [`GeneratorState`] returned by this function is in upon returning.
    /// If the `Yielded` variant is returned then the generator has reached a
    /// suspension point and the value has been yielded out. If `Complete` is
    /// returned then the generator has finished and attempting to resume it
    /// again will result in a panic.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// This function may panic if it is called after the `Complete` variant has
    /// been returned previously. Generators created by the `fauxgen` macros are
    /// guaranteed to panic in this case, custom implementations of
    /// `AsyncGenerator` are not required to do so.
